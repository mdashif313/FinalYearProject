# Understanding Dhaka City Traffic Intensity and Traffic Expansion Using Gravity Model

## Abstract
Analysis of traffic pattern recognition and traffic congestion expansion in real time are one of the exciting and challenging tasks which help the government to build a robust and sustainable traffic management system specially in a densely populated city in the third world developing the country. In this paper, we have processed real-time traffic data of Dhaka rather than depend on survey and interview. We mainly try to understand Dhaka city traffic intensity in a small area which was also known as junction point or in a corridor. We also try to understanding Dhaka city traffic expansion from a congestion point by using gravity model. In this paper, we exactly show that traffic expansion of Dhaka city exactly follows gravity model. Expansion of traffic from a congestion point spread out rapidly to its neighbor and impact of congested point decreases as the distance increases from that congested point. This analysis will help the government to take proper initiative to reducing traffic jam in Dhaka city and to making a planned urbanized Dhaka city.
